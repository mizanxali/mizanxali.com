    <section>
      <p>
        I am a senior software development engineer, based out of Dubai,
        UAE. I currently work at Huddle01 where I have diverse responsibilities
        and the liberty to lead work on multiple systems. I am obsessed with TypeScript and have
        also had my fair share of building apps in the web3 space.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a bachelor's degree in CS Engineering with specialization in
        Gaming Technology from VIT Bhopal University.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love coming up with creative solutions to problems and building
        impeccable software. I enjoy rap music, video games, the works of Da
        Vinci, and Dan Brown novels. I also create and edit videos sometimes.
